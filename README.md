# Fake News Prediction NLP and logical regression model 
Welcome to my fake news prediction model repository! This project uses natural language processing and a logical regression model to predict whether a news article is likely to be fake or not.

The model has been trained on a large dataset of news articles and has achieved high accuracy in its predictions. This project is built using Python and several popular libraries such as NLTK, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.

Feel free to explore the code and try out the model. If you have any feedback or suggestions, I'd love to hear from you!
<!--
I trained the model with the data set provide by the kaggle website which has more than 20,000 entries.
first I preprocesed the data by removing the stopwords then removed the number and other thing expect the word.
later i stemmed the file and vectorized the entire data that is left so that i could be read by the ML model
and i splitted the data as test and training data and trained the model 
and got a accuurrcy rate of 98 on training data.
and 97 on test data. -->
