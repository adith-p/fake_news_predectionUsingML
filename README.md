# fake_news_predectionUsingML
In this project we are using linearregression model as the ML algorithm. 
I trained the model with the data set provide by the kaggle website which has more than 20,000 entries.
first I preprocesed the data by removing the stopwords then removed the number and other thing expect the word.
later i stemmed the file and vectorized the entire data that is left so that i could be read by the ML model.
and i splitted the data as test and training data and trained the model .
and got a accuurrcy rate of 98 on training data.
and 97 on test data.
